class PanuaPardiso:
    '''
    This is an interface to the Panua Pardiso linear solver library.

    https://panua.ch/pardiso/

    The interface supports float(64) and int(32).

    There are three parts to the solution of a linear system:

    1. Symbolic factorization: Analyzes the structure of the nonzero
       pattern. This has to be done before anything else can be done.
    2. Numerical facotorization: Factorizes the matrix, using the
       information from the symbolic factorization.
    3. Solving a linear system:  After the numerical factorization has
       taken place, linear systems can be solved.

    In addition, this interface gives access to a special featue of
    Panua Pardiso. With the "selected inversion" one can compute values
    of the inverse of the matrix at the position of the nonzeros of the
    original matrix.

    The matrix must be provided in csr (compressed sparse row) format.
    For symmtric matrices, internally, only the upper triangular part
    must be given, and nonzeros entries must exist for all diagonal
    elements (even if their values are zero). One can accellerate the
    computation by providing the input matrix already in this form.
    Otherwise, the matrix is internally modified accordingly.

        Initialization of a PanuaPardiso object.  It loads the C
        functions from a shared library and initializes Pardiso.

        Parameters
        ----------

        mtype : int
            Matrix type for the matrices to be handled by this object:
                 1: real and structurally symmetric
                 2: real and symmetric positive defnite
                -2: real and symmetric indefnite
                11: real and nonsymmetric
        verbose : bool
            If True, Pardiso will write its diagnostic output to stdout.
        is_upper_triangular : bool
            For symmetric matrices only.
            If True, only the upper triangular part of the symmetric
            input matrix is provided.  Otherwise, an internal copy is
            formed with the expected structure.
        has_full_diagonal: bool
            For symmetric matrices only.
            If True, all diagonal elements are included in the nonzero
            structure of the input matrix, even for entries with a zero
            value.  Otherwise, an internal copy is formd with the
            expected structure.
        skip_matrix_check : bool
            By default, Pardiso's pardiso_chkmatrix function is called
            for each input matrix as sanity check.  Once the user is
            sure that the input matrix is always properly formed, this
            can be set to True.
        libdir : str
            If this, this is the path to the direction in which the
            Pardiso library libpardiso.* is located.
